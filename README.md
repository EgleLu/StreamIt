# StreamIt
So, it was quite a complex app for a beginner using React and Redux. 
The website allows to stream live your desktop view, but to add stream, edit and delete you should be logged in with Google.
So, it includes google auth.

It is possible to stream using OBS program, but in settings you should change the id of streaming to the same id as it's in databse. For example, localhost path is : http://localhost:3000/streams/6, so 6 is the id.

!important
To start the app on you computer, please run 'npm start' command in all three folders of streams : client, api and rtmpserver. It means, you should have three command propmts windows. (Sorry, it doesn't work perfectly yet)
